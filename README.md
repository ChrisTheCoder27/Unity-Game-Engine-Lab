Project title: Get That Firewood! <br/>
The player will move around a small 3D environment where they collect firewood logs and dodge wolves and bears! If the player's health reaches 0, then the level will restart. Once they've collected enough firewood they can return to their cabin to finish the level.

The pattern I chose to implement was the observer design pattern. The PlayerController class on the player character is the subject, which means it's the object that all of the observers will be listening to for any changes that happen to it. Each observer overrides its "Notify" function to determine how it will respond to a notification from the subject. When the player collides with an enemy, it will set a bool variable, "isShaking", to true and notify the observers. An observer, CameraController, will set its own "isShaking" bool variable to the PlayerController's variable value, and if the value is true, then it will start a coroutine that will cause the player's camera to shake for a short amount of time before stopping the shaking effect. This will only happen when the player just got damaged by an enemy as the bool variable prevents the shaking from happening whenever the observer is notified. I think the observer pattern is a good choice for implementing this because it separates the logic for shaking the camera from the rest of the code in the PlayerController and organizes the functionality for the camera away from the player movement and collision checks. <br>
