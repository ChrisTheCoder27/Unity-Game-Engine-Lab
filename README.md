The UI system in my project uses a singleton, and I chose this system because being able to track different elements of the UI from one script is really useful and it makes it easier to keep track of all of the code related to UI.
I think this design pattern is beneficial for this purpose because there would be no reason to have multiple classes for UI, so using a singleton means that there will only ever be one instance of the class.
